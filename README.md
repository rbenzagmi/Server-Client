# Server-Client

Moving an image between several computer screens (clients) by communication.
There is a server, when you run the application on the server and press the start button, the server starts listening to requests from clients.
When several clients connect to the server, the server saves the clients in order of their connection by the IP of each client's computer.
There is an option on the server to choose which image you want to run on your computer and see examples of the images.
After you select an image, you can press a key that starts moving the image on the clients.
After pressing the key, the image starts running between all the screens in the order they are connected, and finally prints the image from the connected printer.
